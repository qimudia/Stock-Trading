# Stock-Trading: Stock Search Application Homework

In this project, we were tasked with creating a fully fleshed out stock information web application for our client. This application will use the [iexTrading API](https://iextrading.com/developer/docs) to make a dynamic web page that populates with stock information based on the stock symbols that the user inputs. 

#My app:

The app takes the stocks in the array and create buttons in HTML.

It allows users to request additional stock information to be added to the page.

When a user clicks on a stock button, the page grabs the company name, logo, price, and news articles related to the stock from the iexTrading API and place them on the page.

#Validation
If the user enters a stock symbol that already exist, there is an alert that say "stock already exist.."
If user enters an empty string, it will alert "You must input a symbol"
If a user enters an invalid stock, it will alert "Stock symbol does not exist"
#Responsiveness
The app is fully mobile responsive.
